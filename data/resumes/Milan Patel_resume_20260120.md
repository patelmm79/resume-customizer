## SUMMARY
As an executive leader in enterprise AI and advanced analytics with 25 years of experience, I've delivered transformative business outcomes across travel, adtech, financial services, and retail by combining strategic vision, technical depth, and relentless customer focus.

Capital Allocation: I've repeatedly demonstrated executive judgment through tough portfolio decisions, systematically eliminating expensive & low-ROI customizations to redirect capital toward segment-aligned, repeatable solutions that drive recurring revenue and operational leverage.

Leadership & Scale: I've built and scaled high-performing analytics and AI teams responsible for delivering enterprise AI and analytics platforms at scale, enabling insights across the organization while maintaining governance and responsible practices.

Versatility: Whether architecting ML/AI platforms, engaging C-suite stakeholders, coding in Python, mentoring technical teams, or navigating complex multinational environments across time zones, I combine technical credibility with strategic business acumen. My Spanish is as strong as my Python.
